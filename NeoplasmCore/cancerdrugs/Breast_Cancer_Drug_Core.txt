Fluorouracil and its metabolites possess a number of different mechanisms of action. In vivo, fluoruracil is converted to the active metabolite 5-fluoroxyuridine monophosphate (F-UMP); replacing uracil, F-UMP incorporates into RNA and inhibits RNA processing, thereby inhibiting cell growth. Another active metabolite, 5-5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-O-monophosphate (F-dUMP), inhibits thymidylate synthase, resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP), one of the four nucleotide triphosphates used in the in vivo synthesis of DNA. Other fluorouracil metabolites incorporate into both RNA and DNA; incorporation into RNA results in major effects on both RNA processing and functions.	Drugs Approved to Treat Breast Cancer

Mimicking the action of progesterone, megestrol acetate binds to and activates nuclear progesterone receptors in the reproductive system, and causes the ligand-receptor complex to be translocated to the nucleus where it binds to and promotes expression of target genes. This leads to an alteration in protein synthesis, which modulates cell growth of reproductive tissues. Due to the negative feedback mechanism seen with progesterone, megestrol also blocks luteinizing hormone (LH) release from the pituitary gland, thereby leading to an inhibition of ovulation and an alteration in the cervical mucus and endometrium. Furthermore, without stimulation of LH, estrogen release from the ovaries is stopped, hence impedes the growth of estrogen-sensitive tumor cells.	Drugs Approved to Treat Breast Cancer

C855	Tamoxifen	Tamoxifen Citrate|(Z)-2-[4-(1,2-Diphenyl-1-butenyl)phenoxy]-N,N-dimethylethanamine 2-Hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylate|(Z)-2-[4-(1,2-diphenyl-1-butenyl)phenoxy]-N,N-dimethylethanamine citrate|1-p-beta-dimethylamino-ethoxyphenyl-trans-1,2-diphenylbut-1-ene Citrate|Apo-Tamox|Clonoxifen|Dignotamoxi|Ebefen|Emblon|Estroxyn|Fentamox|Gen-Tamoxifen|Genox|ICI 46,474|ICI-46474|Jenoxifen|Kessar|Ledertam|Lesporene|Nolgen|Noltam|Nolvadex|Nolvadex-D|Nourytam|Novo-Tamoxifen|Novofen|Noxitem|Oestrifen|Oncotam|PMS-Tamoxifen|Soltamox|TAM|TAMOXIFEN CITRATE|Tamax|Tamaxin|Tamifen|Tamizam|Tamofen|Tamoxasta|Tamoxifen citrate|Tamoxifeni Citras|Zemide|tamoxifen citrate	The citrate salt of an antineoplastic nonsteroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Tamoxifen competitively inhibits the binding of estradiol to estrogen receptors, thereby preventing the receptor from binding to the estrogen-response element on DNA. The result is a reduction in DNA synthesis and cellular response to estrogen. In addition, tamoxifen up-regulates the production of transforming growth factor B (TGFb), a factor that inhibits tumor cell growth, and down-regulates insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a factor that stimulates breast cancer cell growth. Tamoxifen also down-regulates protein kinase C (PKC) expression in a dose-dependant manner, inhibiting signal transduction and producing an antiproliferative effect in tumors such as malignant glioma and other cancers that overexpress PKC.

Upon administration, thiotepa is converted into highly reactive ethylenimine groups, which covalently bind to nucleophilic groups in DNA and demonstrate a preference for the N7 position of guanine bases. This induces crosslinking of alkylated guanine bases in double-stranded DNA, interferes with both DNA replication and cell division, and results in both the induction of apoptosis and the inhibition of cell growth.

C1256	Toremifene	Toremifene|(Z)-2-[4-(4-Chloro-1,2-diphenyl-1-butenyl)phenoxy]-N,N-dimethylethanamine|(Z)-4-Chloro-1,2-diphenyl-1[4-[2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethoxy]phenyl]-1-butene|Farestone|TOREMIFENE|toremifene	A nonsteroidal triphenylethylene antiestrogen.  Chemically related to tamoxifen, toremifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM).  This agent binds competitively to estrogen receptors, thereby interfering with estrogen activity.  Toremifene also has intrinsic estrogenic properties, which are manifested according to tissue type or species. (NCI04)	Drugs Approved to Treat Breast Cancer

The trastuzumab moiety of this ADC binds to HER2 on tumor cell surfaces; upon internalization, the DM1 moiety is released and binds to tubulin, thereby disrupting microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics and inhibiting cell division and the proliferation of cancer cells that overexpress HER2. Linkage of antibody and drug through a nonreducible linker has been reported to contribute to the improved efficacy and reduced toxicity of this ADC compared to similar ADCs constructed with reducible linkers.
