<p>The NCIt Neoplasm Core value set provides a core reference set of 
NCIt neoplasm classification concepts that is designed to facilitate 
consistent coding, analysis, and data sharing across a broad range of 
NCI and related resources.  These files provide a comprehensive 
collection of key terms, definitions, simplified hierarchies, mappings 
to dozens of other terminologies, and molecular characteristics, all 
linked back to online EVS resources; they are updated with each monthly 
release of NCIt.

</p><p><b>Background:</b> NCIt provides NCI's comprehensive cancer 
classification terminology and ontology, and NCIm provides 
cross-mappings to many related terminologies of interest to the NCI 
community.  NCIt includes rigorous human and machine readable 
definitions of many thousands of distinct types of neoplasm, organized 
in logic based parent-child hierarchies.  NCIt is used in many NCI and 
other systems around the world for cancer research, care, and reference,
 and is useful in interpreting and translating information from many 
other resources.  The need has long been felt for a smaller core 
reference set of cancer classification terms that are most commonly used
 for research, care, and public health purposes.

</p><p><b>Organization:</b> This draft set includes 1,358 neoplasm 
concepts (16%) out of the 8,399 currently in NCIt.   It is intended to 
include all neoplasms frequently encountered in research and clinical 
settings.  Beyond that, EVS estimates that this set includes 
approximately 80% of infrequent and rare neoplasms encountered in such 
settings, as well as 60% of the specific histopathologic variants of 
malignant neoplasms.  Most of these concepts have tracked uses in coding
 NCI's main clinical trial and metadata repositories.</p>

<p>Set membership and structure, including hierarchy and mapping 
relationships, will be adjusted and extended in response to user 
feedback.  This set will be made available in multiple views.  It is an 
integral subset of NCIt, so users can easily cross-walk to more detailed
 classifications, ontology, terminology mappings, and links to key 
cancer information resources.</p>

<p>This third monthly release includes four components:</p>
    
<ol>
  <li><b>Value Set</b>: 1,358 concepts, available from the
    <a href="https://nciterms.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/ajax?action=create_src_vs_tree&amp;vsd_uri=http://evs.nci.nih.gov/valueset/C126659">NCI Term Browser</a>,
 LexEVS APIs, and the files on this FTP site.  An RDF/SPARQL endpoint is
 also available internally, and is being prepared for public use.  The 
files here are available in these forms:

  </li><li><b>Simplified Hierarchy</b>: The main draft hierarchy 
organizes Neoplasm Core concepts in parent-child "is-a" relationships 
under the main NCIt subcategories of <em>Neoplasm by Site</em> and <em>Neoplasm by Morphology</em>.
  Only the relationships between Core concepts appear, in their most 
specific placements, yielding a hierarchy much simpler than the full 
NCIt hierarchy.  The hierarchy is available in two main forms, with two 
"Plus" forms that add an NCIm CUI/link (HTML only) and Neoplastic Status
 flag to each Core term:
    
    <p></p><ul>
      <li> <a href="http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NCI_Thesaurus/Neoplasm/Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy.html">Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy.html</a>
 is an HTML hierarchy with nodes that can be expanded and collapsed, 
either individually or globally.  Each term is linked to its concept 
page on the NCIt browser.
      </li><li> <a href="http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NCI_Thesaurus/Neoplasm/Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_Plus.html">Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_Plus.html</a>
 As above, plus each term is also linked to its concept page on the NCIm
 browser and shows the Neoplastic Status value (Malignant, Benign, 
Undetermined).
      </li><li> <a href="http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NCI_Thesaurus/Neoplasm/Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy.txt">Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy.txt</a> is the same hierarchy in a simple text format, with the NCIt Code in parentheses following the term.
      </li><li> <a href="http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NCI_Thesaurus/Neoplasm/Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_Plus.txt">Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_Plus.txt</a> As above, plus each term  also shows the Neoplastic Status value (Malignant, Benign, Undetermined).
    </li></ul><p></p>
    
    <p>NCIt users have asked that we also provide the earlier draft 
hierarchy arrangement under Neoplastic Status headings of Malignant, 
Benign, and Undetermined.  These updated files assign each Core 
hierarchical group based on the status of the top parent concept, so the
 Undetermined section includes many malignant and benign child concepts.
  As with the main hierarchy files, there are html and text files that 
follow the original format, and "Plus" forms that add an NCIm CUI/link 
(HTML only) and Neoplastic Status flag to each Core term: 
    
    </p><p></p><ul>
      <li> <a href="http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NCI_Thesaurus/Neoplasm/Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_By_Neoplastic_Status.html">Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_By_Neoplastic_Status.html</a>
 is an HTML hierarchy with nodes that can be expanded and collapsed, 
either individually or globally.  Each term is linked to its concept 
page on the NCIt browser.
      </li><li> <a href="http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NCI_Thesaurus/Neoplasm/Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_By_Neoplastic_Status_Plus.html">Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_By_Neoplastic_Status_Plus.html</a>
 As above, plus each term is also linked to its concept page on the NCIm
 browser and shows the Neoplastic Status value (Malignant, Benign, 
Undetermined).
      </li><li> <a href="http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NCI_Thesaurus/Neoplasm/Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_By_Neoplastic_Status.txt">Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_By_Neoplastic_Status.txt</a> is the same hierarchy in a simple text format, with the NCIt Code in parentheses following the term.
      </li><li> <a href="http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NCI_Thesaurus/Neoplasm/Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_By_Neoplastic_Status_Plus.txt">Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_By_Neoplastic_Status_Plus.txt</a> As above, plus each term  also shows the Neoplastic Status value (Malignant, Benign, Undetermined).
    </li></ul><p></p>
    
<p>The original, manually curated draft hierarchy is available in the Archive directory, in two forms:</p>
    
    <p></p><ul>
      <li> <a href="http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NCI_Thesaurus/Neoplasm/Archive/Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_2016-05-02.html">Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_2016-05-02.html</a>
 is an HTML hierarchy with nodes that can be expanded and collapsed.  
Each term is linked to its concept page on the NCIt browser.
      </li><li> <a href="http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NCI_Thesaurus/Neoplasm/Archive/Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_2016-05-02.txt">Neoplasm_Core_Hierarchy_2016-05-02.txt</a> is the same hierarchy in a simple text format, with the NCIt Code in parentheses following the term.
    </li></ul><p></p>

    <p>Several simplified hierarchies may well be needed; user input 
will be important in deciding on the most useful organization and scope 
for these.</p>

    <p>Once there is a stable simplified reference hierarchy, EVS plans 
to retire the old Common Neoplasm (Code C7077) header concept and 
hierarchy, including these four child concepts: Common Carcinoma, Common
 Connective and Soft Tissue Neoplasm, Common Germ Cell Tumor, and Common
 Hematopoietic Neoplasm.  These were created in 2003 to help satisfy 
such requests when no better solution was readily available, but 
structured value sets provide a more appropriate representation.  Please
 say if this transition may cause problems for your current use of NCIt.</p>

NCIm code and term.  30% (411) do not have equivalent terms in other 
terminologies, so the remaining cells are empty.  Where other sources in
 NCIm do have equivalent terms, a separate row is created for each 
unique term mapping.  The mappings tables are available in three forms:

    <p>These term mappings are also available as simple lists, with 
equivalent NCIm source terms in indented lists under each Core term.  
This is available in two formats:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Each Core term is linked to its NCIt concept page on the NCIt browser.
	  </li><li>For EVS standalone sources, each source/code pair is linked to its page in the NCI Term Browser.

    </li></ul>
    
    <p>An earlier draft Mappings file provided a single row for each

  </li><li><b>Molecular Relationships:</b> NCIt Neoplasm concepts are 
characterized by well over 100,000 role relationships to other NCIt 
concepts, which in turn have potentially revealing connections to many 
others.  This initial draft relationship report provides a simple 
listing for just 6 roles, with more than 4,900 assertions for Core 
neoplasm concepts, that are most informative about the molecular 
characteristics of neoplasms:
    <ul>

    These roles connect
    <ol>
      <li>Specific genes and fusion genes to specific histopathologic 
types of neoplasms, when these genes and fusion genes are directly 
involved in the pathogenesis of the specific neoplasms;

    <p>Future releases may extend the coverage of molecular 
relationships, and may display relationship groupings that show, for 
example, how a particular chromosomal translocation relates to the 
corresponding fusion protein, and how these may both relate to 
prognosis.  Feedback is invited on what information would be most 
useful.</p>
